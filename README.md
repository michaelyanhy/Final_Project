I want to create an interactive webpage that provides users with real-time feedback, like a small game or something similar. However, I'm currently unsure how to implement it, especially controlling time and handling user input since webpages don't have a keyboard.

Will try to build a game without time controller. Use addEventListener function to catch user input.

In the lastest version, I use onclick to listen to event.

Have not uploaded the part that detemine who is the winner. There still something wrong within it.
