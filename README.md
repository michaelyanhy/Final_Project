31/07 I want to create an interactive webpage that provides users with real-time feedback, like a small game or something similar. However, I'm currently unsure how to implement it, especially controlling time and handling user input since webpages don't have a keyboard.

02/08 Will try to build a game without time controller. Use addEventListener function to catch user input.

07/08 In the lastest version, I use onclick to listen to event.

09/08 Have not uploaded the part that detemine who is the winner. There still something wrong within it.

12/08 The program is working fine.

13/08 Added a restart button and background music.

14/08 Changed some display styleï¼ŒAdjusting screen responsiveness for narrow-screen devices, primarily mobile phones. Simultaneously addressing frame drop issues caused by screen responsiveness and rotation animations.
