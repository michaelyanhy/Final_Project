I want to create an interactive webpage that provides users with real-time feedback, like a small game or something similar. However, I'm currently unsure how to implement it, especially controlling time and handling user input since webpages don't have a keyboard.
Will try to build a game without time controller. Use addEventListener function to catch user input.
